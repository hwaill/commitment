			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>I'm a transfer student from New York studying Technology, Arts and Media, and minoring in Music and Computer Science. I spend my time playing piano, creating generative art, climbing and falling down when I try to ski.</p>

			<h2>Web Experience</h2>
			<p>I started learning HTML and CSS early in high school as my first step to become a computer scientist. Of course, I realized how far off I was when I started learning Java a few years down the line. I've since slowly increased my knowledge and experience through personal web design projects. I hope to become a more skilled web designer and make creating websites a large part of my career.

			<h2>Goals for the class</h2>
			<p>In this class, I hope to gain a better understanding of what a professional workflow looks like in web development. I have some experience with HTML and CSS pre-processors like SASS and Pug, but know that I have only scratched the surface of what they're capable of. I'm also excited to learn about tools like Emmet and others that improve efficiency in development.
